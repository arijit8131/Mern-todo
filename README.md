Set up a **MongoDB** database
Set up server using **Node** and **Express**
Create a database schema to define a Todo
Set up **API**routes to create, read, update and delete documents from the database
Testing our **API**routes using **REST client**

# Frontend
Set up our frontend using **create-react-app** 
Create components for reading all the todo, creating todo and updating todo
